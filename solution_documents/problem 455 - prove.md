## 455. Assign Cookies  

Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor gi, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

Note:
You may assume the greed factor is always positive. 
You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.


```
Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3], [1,1]

Output: 1

Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.
Example 2:
Input: [1,2], [1,2,3]

Output: 2

Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.

将一块饼干分给他所能满足的最大的贪心孩子
这个需要看一下贪婪算法的证明  
这个算法是任务调度的变种 需要看其证明

##### mycode
```
class Solution(object):
    def findContentChildren(self, g, s):
        """
        :type g: List[int]
        :type s: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        g.sort()
        g.reverse()
        s.sort()
        s.reverse()

        max_val=0
        st_index=0
        length=len(s)
        for greed_child in g:
            if st_index>=length:
                break
            if s[st_index]>=greed_child:
                max_val+=1
                st_index+=1
                continue
        return max_val
```
